# Weaved plugin for automata

Plugin for my Automata framework for controlling a weaved device

It has basic on/off control of the embedded relay.

# NOTES

To use this you will need to add a configuration option in the main automata config.
The config option is: weavedAddress
I use a URL outside of the address controlled by Weaved as I was having difficulty using their API for it.
